🧠 CNN  (Facial Emotion Classifier)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different categories using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained on labeled images using supervised learning and achieved strong performance in identifying patterns and features from image data.

🚀 Project Overview
Built a CNN model from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras

Trained on custom image dataset organized in directories (e.g., train/, val/)

Used ImageDataGenerator for real-time data augmentation and rescaling

Evaluated performance on a validation set

Visualized model accuracy and loss across epochs

Implemented TensorBoard for monitoring training in real time
